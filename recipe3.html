			<p style="font-size: larger;"><b><i></i>Instructions:</i></b></p>
			<p>Rinse 1 cup of quinoa under cold water, then cook it according to the package instructions. Once cooked, fluff it with a fork and set it aside. Press the tofu to remove excess water by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel and placing a heavy object on top, then cut the tofu into cubes. Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, adding a bit of oil, and fry the tofu cubes until they are golden brown on all sides. Remove the tofu from the pan and set it aside. In the same skillet or wok, add a bit more oil if needed, then add minced garlic and grated ginger, sautéing for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add sliced mushrooms and broccoli florets, stir-frying for 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender but still crisp. Return the fried tofu to the pan with the vegetables, mixing everything together. Pour soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and agave syrup over the tofu and vegetables, stirring to coat evenly. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Add the cooked quinoa to the pan and toss everything together until well combined and heated through. Transfer the stir-fried quinoa, tofu, and vegetables to serving bowls, garnishing with chopped green onions and sesame seeds if available. Serve and enjoy!</p>
