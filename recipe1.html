			<p>
				in a bowl, combine diced chicken with taco seasonings, mixing well to coat the chicken. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the seasoned chicken, cooking until browned and cooked through, approximately 5-7 minutes. Set aside. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms until golden brown, then add diced red onion and cook until softened. Toss in halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften, then add fresh spinach and cook until wilted. Remove from heat. Warm tortillas according to package instructions, then place a spoonful of the cooked chicken in the center of each tortilla. Top with the sautéed vegetable mixture, sprinkle shredded cheese over the chicken and vegetable filling, and drizzle sour cream over the top. Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired. Serve and enjoy!
