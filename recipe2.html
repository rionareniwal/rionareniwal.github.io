			<p style="font-size: larger;"><b><i>Instructions:</i></b></p>
			<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Clean the mushrooms and remove the stems, then place the mushroom caps on a baking sheet or in a baking dish, ready for stuffing. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat, adding minced garlic and sautéing for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add chopped spinach to the skillet and cook until wilted, stirring occasionally. Once spinach is cooked, remove skillet from heat and add breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to taste, mixing thoroughly. Using a teaspoon, fill each mushroom cap with the spinach mixture, pressing it down gently. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top of each stuffed mushroom. Place stuffed mushrooms in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the mushrooms are cooked through. Remove from the oven and, if desired, garnish with fresh parsley. Allow them to cool slightly before serving. Serve and enjoy!
