	  		<h2 style="color: darkblue;">Hey there!</h2>

		<p>I'm <strong>Riona Reniwal</strong>, currently in my sophomore year at the <b>University of Wisconsin-Madison</b>. Here I study Information Science, with a minor in Data Science. I love to cook and have always been incredibly passionate about trying out new cuisines and different foods. In my freshman year of college, the lack of time, finances, and access to healthy food in the dining halls really restricted me from eating well-balanced and nutritious meals. This greatly affected my mental and physical health. Thatâ€™s why I started cooking meals for myself instead. I strived hard to learn and create meals that were accessible to every skill set and that stood out from the monotonous and repetitive PB&J sandwiches. College life doesn't have to mean compromising on nutrition or blowing your budget. Join me as I explore the realm of healthy and budget-friendly meals tailored for the college lifestyle.I also wanted to share one of my main inspirations for easy recipes, her name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chloeevegan/"><i>Chloe E Wheatland</i> </a> and she is another amazing resource to check out!</p>
